		<h2>Why Improv?</h2>
		<p>Let me be the first to tell you. Improv is not about being funny. It's about being a human grounded in listening and investing in one idea. It's not about being the top person either. It's aout being a teammate. Often in life, teams create their own barriers of effective communication with another because they are missing the basic forms of communication. Our Corporate Improv Training is designed to help teams re-align with one another so they can properly have more effective meetings, brainstorm more creatively, and exceed sales goals.</p>
		<h3>Let's Look at the Research</h3>
		<p>Research shows that improv is good for your brain and improves blood flow. The same chemicals that go off in a Jazz Musicians' brain when they are playing with their team are the same that are seen in an improv scene. Groups that have improvised together have had more effective and creative team meetings and have led to higher sales growth.</p>

			<h3>Drop Your Agenda, and Listen</h3>
			<p>Skip the small stalk and start getting specific and investing in the person you are talking with. In brainstorming, we tend to focus on so many different ideas, that we start at the same point where we started. Zero. Yes, And takes us to a new level of investing in ideas, but most important, our teammates around us.</p>

			<h3>Connect</h3>
			<p>Improv is a team game. The best sports teams have one thing in common. They play as a team. Improv suggests that you stop being the hero, and make others the hero on a daily basis. In a business environment, how can we set up our customers and team members up for succes.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="column">
			<h3>Commitment</h3>
			<p>Often times we know the right thing to do. We know what we should do, but we're scared to step up the plate. Commitment is about owning who you are and what you bring to the table and to stop shying away from it. The biggest you can give to someone else is all of who you are in your most committed sense.</p>
