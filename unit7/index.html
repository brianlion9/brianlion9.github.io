		<div id="box"><span class="grey">Stop being</span><br>funny.<br><span class="grey">Start being</span><br>connected.
		</div>
		<p>Let me be the first to tell you. Improv is not about being funny. I know that may sound counter intuitive because when you go to an improv show, all you do is laugh. Right? What makes improv funny though is not in the funny one-liners, or the person who thinks they're a stand up comedian. The people who are best at improv are grounded in listening, investing in one idea, and supporting their teammates. It's not about being the best performer. It's aout being the best teammate.</p>

		<p>Often in life, teams create their own barriers of effective communication with another because they are missing the basic forms of communication. We get in our own way.</p>

		<p>Seriously, Improv is designed to help teams re-align with one another so they can properly have effective meetings, group mindsets, and fun throughout the whole process.</p>

		<h3>Let's Look at the Research</h3>
		<p id="sup">Research shows that improv is good for your brain and improves blood flow. The same chemicals that go off in a Jazz Musicians' brain when they are playing with their team are the same that are seen in an improv scene. Groups that have improvised together have had more effective and creative team meetings and have led to higher sales growth.</p>

		<div class="column">
			<h3>Drop Your Agenda, and Listen</h3>
			<p>Skip the small talk and start getting specific and investing in the person you are talking with. In brainstorming, we tend to focus on so many different ideas, that we start at the same point where we started. Zero. Yes, And takes us to a new level of investing in ideas, but most important, our teammates around us.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="column">
			<h3>Connect</h3>
			<p>Improv is a team game. The best sports teams have one thing in common. They play as a team. Improv suggests that you stop being the hero, and make others the hero on a daily basis. In a business environment, how can we set up our customers and team members up for succes.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="column">
			<h3>Commit</h3>
			<p>Often times we know the right thing to do. We know what we should do, but we're scared to step up the plate. Commitment is about owning who you are and what you bring to the table and to stop shying away from it. The biggest you can give to someone else is all of who you are in your most committed sense.</p>
