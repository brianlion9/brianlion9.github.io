  <h3>Why Improv?</h3>
  <p>Let me be the first to tell you. Improv is not about being funny. It's about being a human grounded in listening and investing in one idea. It's not about being the top person either. It's aout being a teammate. Often in life, teams create their own barriers of effective communication with another because they are missing the basic forms of communication. Our Corporate Improv Training is designed to help teams re-align with one another so they can properly have more effective meetings, brainstorm more creatively, and exceed sales goals.</p>
